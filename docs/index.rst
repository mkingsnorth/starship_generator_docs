Add random scifi spaceships to your scene in |Blender| and export them to applications such as Unreal Engine.  For concept artists and game developers who wish to create background 3D models for use in art, animation, games, or as a source of inspiration.

---------------------------------
Features
---------------------------------

* Simply add a *Starship* model to your scene from Blender's *Add -> Mesh* Menu.
* Create different designs by changing a single seed number.
* Customize the Geometry Nodes set up in Blender: no custom code.
* Choose panels added to the 3D model or an included Cycles displacement material.
* Change the material and increase or decrease object density.
* Collapse all the modifiers for a regular 3D model.
* Created with design theory in mind to ensure the shapes are visually appealing.
* Look at example .blend file setups provided.

* |Use the built in displacement material| instead of 3D panels.
* |Export the model| into other 3D applications such as Unreal Engine. See this video.
* |Add your own objects| instead of the built-in ones.
* |Use the Blender Remesh modifier| to create a watertight model for 3D printing or sculpting. See this video.

---------------------------------
Caveats
---------------------------------

* The add-on can not create *any* type of spaceship imaginable; it is focused on creating ships similar to the |Sulaco| from Aliens or the |Rocinante| from The Expanse.
* Best used for medium/background shots unless further modelling and sculpting is applied.
* Designed to be as fast as possible, but performance will vary from computer to computer when changing parameters.
* May cause the need to spend hours clicking through the seed values just to see which designs you get.
