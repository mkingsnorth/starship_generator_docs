---------------------------------
What is the Starship Generator?
---------------------------------

Add random scifi spaceships to your scene in |Blender| and export them to applications such as **Unreal Engine**.  For concept artists and game developers who wish to quickly create background 3D models for use in art, animation, or games.

---------------------------------
Features
---------------------------------

* Simply add a model to your scene from Blender's Add Menu.
* Create different shapes just by changing a single seed number.
* Change the proportions of the default shapes.
* Increase or decrease object density.
* Control the complexity of the object.
* Change the default material.
* Choose between panel effects, either:
  
    * Panels added to 3D model.
  
    * Included Cycles displacement material for greater detail. See video.
  
* Customize the Geometry Nodes set up in Blender.
* Collapse all the modifiers for a regular 3D model.
* Created with design theory in mind to ensure the shapes are visually appealing.
* Look at example .blend file setups provided.



---------------------------------
How-to Videos
---------------------------------

* Add your own objects. See this video.
* Use the built in dispacement material instead of 3D panels (See this video).
* Export the model into other 3D applications such as Unreal Engine. See this video.
* Use Blender's Remesh modifier to create a watertight model for 3D printing or sculpting. See this video.
* Included in Downloads: Learn how the Generator Model was made using Blender.

---------------------------------
Caveats
---------------------------------

* The add-on does not create any type of spaceship imaginable; it is mainly focused on creating ships similar to the *Sulaco* from Aliens or the *Rocinante* from The Expanse.
* Best used for medium/background shots unless further modelling and sculpting is applied.
* Although designed to be as fast as possible, performance when changing parameters will vary from computer to computer or if subdivisions controls are set high.
* May cause the need to spend hours clicking through the seed values just to see which designs you get.
