#. Open Blender and :ref:`install<Installation>` the add-on if you haven't already.
#. Start a new scene and delete the default cube, or open an existing scene.
#. Add a *Starship* object through the standard *Add -> Mesh* menu in Blender. Access this menu either through the *Object* menu at the top of the 3D view or by pressing *Shift+A*. Select the *Starship* option:

#.  A new random starship model will be added to the scene.

#. Expand the small menu that appears in the bottom left of the viewport marked *Starship*.

#. Change the seed number until you find a shape you might like.  Don't worry if this initial menu disappears when you click away: you can always change the seed value later by going to the :ref:`Starship Controls Modifier`.

#. Note in the Outline view that a new *Starship Generator* **Collection** has been added to the scene, which contains the *Starship* object and its hidden supporting components. Adding more starships will add more collections:

#. With the *Starship* object selected, go to the *modifiers* tab where you can change the :ref:`controls`:
